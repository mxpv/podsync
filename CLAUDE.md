# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Podsync is a Go-based service that converts YouTube, Vimeo, and SoundCloud channels into podcast feeds. It downloads video/audio content and generates RSS feeds that can be consumed by podcast clients.

## Key Architecture Components

### Main Application (`cmd/podsync/`)
- **main.go**: Entry point with CLI argument parsing, signal handling, and service orchestration
- **config.go**: TOML configuration loading and validation with defaults

### Core Packages (`pkg/`)
- **builder/**: Media downloaders for different platforms (YouTube, Vimeo, SoundCloud)
- **feed/**: RSS/podcast feed generation and management, OPML export
- **db/**: BadgerDB-based storage for metadata and state
- **fs/**: Storage abstraction supporting local filesystem and S3-compatible storage
- **model/**: Core data structures and domain models
- **ytdl/**: YouTube-dl wrapper for media downloading

### Services (`services/`)
- **update/**: Feed update orchestration and scheduling
- **web/**: HTTP server for serving podcast feeds and media files

### Key Dependencies
- youtube-dl/yt-dlp for media downloading
- BadgerDB for local storage
- go-toml for configuration
- robfig/cron for scheduling
- AWS SDK for S3 storage

## Common Development Commands

### Building
```bash
make build          # Build binary to bin/podsync
make                # Build and run tests
```

### Testing
```bash
make test           # Run all unit tests
go test -v ./...    # Run tests with verbose output
go test ./pkg/...   # Test specific packages
```

### Linting and Formatting
```bash
golangci-lint run   # Run all configured linters and formatters
gofmt -s -w .       # Format all Go files
goimports -w .      # Organize imports and format
```

### Running
```bash
./bin/podsync --config config.toml    # Run with config file
./bin/podsync --debug                 # Run with debug logging
./bin/podsync --headless              # Run once and exit (no web server)
```

### Docker
```bash
make docker                           # Build local Docker image
docker run -it --rm localhost/podsync:latest
```

### Development Debugging
Use VS Code with the Go extension. The repository includes `.vscode/launch.json` with a "Debug Podsync" configuration that runs with `config.toml`.

## Configuration

The application uses TOML configuration files. See `config.toml.example` for all available options. Key sections:
- `[server]`: Web server settings (port, hostname, TLS)
- `[storage]`: Local or S3 storage configuration  
- `[tokens]`: API keys for YouTube/Vimeo
- `[feeds]`: Feed definitions with URLs and settings
- `[downloader]`: youtube-dl configuration

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Write clean, idiomatic Go code following Go conventions and best practices
- Use structured logging with logrus for consistent log formatting
- Ensure proper error handling and meaningful error messages
- Follow the existing code style and patterns in the repository

### Testing and Quality Assurance
- **CRITICAL**: Always run BOTH `make test` AND `golangci-lint run` after making any code changes
- Run tests first with `make test` to ensure functionality works correctly
- Run linter with `golangci-lint run` to ensure proper formatting and code quality
- Ensure ALL tests pass AND ALL linting checks pass before committing
- Review code carefully for spelling errors, typos, and grammatical mistakes
- Test changes locally with different configurations when applicable
- The project uses golangci-lint with strict formatting rules - code must pass ALL checks

### Git Workflow
- Write short, expressive commit messages that clearly describe the change
- Do not include automated signatures or generation notices in commit messages or pull requests
- Don't add "Generated with Claude Code" to commit messages or pull request descriptions
- Don't add "Co-Authored-By: Claude noreply@anthropic.com" to commit messages or pull request descriptions
- Keep commits focused and atomic - one logical change per commit
- Ensure the build passes before pushing commits

## Key Conventions

- Configuration validation happens at startup
- Graceful shutdown with context cancellation
- Storage abstraction allows switching between local/S3
- API key rotation support for rate limiting
- Cron-based scheduling for feed updates
- Episode filtering and cleanup capabilities

## Formatting and Linting Requirements

This project uses golangci-lint with strict formatting rules configured in `.golangci.yml`. Common formatting requirements include:

- Proper spacing around operators (`if condition {` not `if(condition){`)
- Correct struct field alignment and spacing
- Proper import ordering (standard library, third-party, local packages)
- No trailing whitespace
- Consistent spacing around assignment operators (`key: value` not `key:value`)
- Space after commas in function parameters and struct literals

**Always run BOTH `make test` AND `golangci-lint run` after making ANY code changes to ensure both functionality and formatting are correct before committing.**
